Description: CytoQP (Quality Pipeline) offers a pipeline to pre-process
    cytometry data, especially the one acquired on CyTOF/HELIOS
    instruments.  It joins all together tools necessary to perform
    bead-based normalization, flow rate and signal cleaning, quality
    control of the files, debarcoding, aggregation and deconvolution,
    gating and normalization using REF samples.  It also extract verifies
    batch effect and extract features like cell frequencies and median
    signal intensities.
